emulate_rd(roxygen)

\description{
We leverage roxygen2 workhorse function \code{\link[roxygen2:roc_proc_text]{roxygen2::roc_proc_text()}} if
our input contains character that have to be escaped. Since this is an
expensive operation, we opt out of it and perform a simple
\code{remove_roxygen_mask()} when there are no characters to escape.
